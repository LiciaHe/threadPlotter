#ThreadPlotter
_A toolkit for the design and fabrication of delicate punch needle embroidery using X-Y plotters_ 
 
 ##What?
ThreadPlotter is a toolkit that supports the designing, editing, and printing of images as punch needle embroidery using a X-Y plotter. It is a supplemantary material for the paper:

["Plotting with Thread: Fabricating Delicate Punch Needle Embroidery with X-Y Plotters"
 Shiqing He, Eytan Adar, to appear, DIS'20, Honorable Mention Award](http://www.cond.org/punchneedle.html)

The following video briefly introduce the motivation for building this tool and the capability of the ThreadPlotter.

 ##How?
 To convert your X-Y plotter into a punch needle fabricator, we will follow the following steps:
  1. Ensure that your plotter is suitable for the task. ([tutorial 1](../tutorial/step1_plotterCheck.md))
  2. Acquire or create several physical components such as needle, fabric, and frame. ([tutorial 2](../tutorial/step2_physicalSetup.md))
  3. Design a punch needle pattern. 
     1. [tutorial 3: pattern making overview](../tutorial/step3_patternMaking.md)
     2. [tutorial 4: advanced examples](../tutorial/step4_advancedExamples.md)

 ## Show us! Tell us! Ask us! Credit us!
 We are excited to see what you can create with this fabrication technique. The toolkit is developed and tested by Licia (on her plotter called "Kitty"). If you have questions about the toolkit, feel free to open up an issue in our [github page](https://github.com/LiciaHe/threadPlotter).   
 
 If you created something and want to share it with us, please use the tag [#plotterembroidery](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/plotterembroidery/?hl=en) on SNS.
