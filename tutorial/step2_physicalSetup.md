#Step 2: Physical Setup 

In this section, we will go over materials needed for the fabrication process, including fabric, fabric stretcher, thread,  thread feeder, clamp, and punch needle. 

##Fabric 

We tested six different types of fabrics. Pearlized Iridescent Organza (1) and Organza (2)  can produce stable results. Weavers Cloth (3) is too thick for our machine to pierce. Chiffon (4) and Twinkle Organza (5) are too fragile for the gripper frame we used. Sheer Voile (6) can produce reasonable results but tends to have missing loops.
