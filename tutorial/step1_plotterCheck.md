# Step 1: Plotter Check 
Not all X-Y plotter is suitable for the task. Before you start, you should double-check that your machine is suitable for the task. Our [paper](http://www.cond.org/punchneedle.pdf) describe this in detail. 

In our experiment, we  chose to convert the commercially available [AxiDraw Pen Plotter (V3/A3 model)](https://axidraw.com/). 

In our study, we hoped to avoid physically modifying our plotter to perform its original function. We identify the following criteria for selecting a plotter.

#### You can use a plotter (or any other CNC) if all of these criteria are met:

 1. It provides movement in 3 directions (x, y, and z). 
 2. It can hold a punch needle tool. 
 3. The distance between the plotting tool and the plotting surface is adjustable and sufficient for holding a fabric stretching frame. 
    1. e.g., if your plotter has a paper feeder, it might not be able to perform the task. 
    
4. The z-axis movement is large enough to create a minimal stitch.
    1. If your plotter cannot move more than 5cm in the z-direction, it might not be able to perform the task.
    
5. A sufficient downward force can be applied in the z-axis to punch through the tightened fabric.
    1. If your plotter is not drawing on a flat surface, it might be challenging to add additional z-axis force. 

## Next Step 
Once you have the right plotter, please take a look at [step 2: prepare materials](step2_physicalSetup.md).
